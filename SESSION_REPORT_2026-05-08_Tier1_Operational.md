## Hardware Inventory — Confirmed Operational

| Device | USB ID | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| HackRF One | 1d50:6089 | ✓ Online | Rev r9, fw v2.1.0, s/n …61dc2a7c5f4f |

| Raspberry Pi 5 | — | ✓ Running | PI5-ALPHA, Pi OS Bookworm |

**HackRF amp status:** BLOWN — parts on order. Amp locked out in software (see fixes below).

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Double Dashboard/Waterfall Instances (FIXED)

**Root cause:** Two autostart desktop files in `~/.config/autostart/` both called
`launch_project.sh`:
- `dslv-zpdi.desktop` — direct, no boot delay
- `dslv-zpdi-dashboard.desktop` — wrapped in lxterminal with 25 s sleep

Each invocation of `launch_project.sh` spawns **two** lxterminal windows (waterfall +
main dashboard). Two autostart entries → four terminal windows, two pipeline restarts.

**Fix:** Disabled `dslv-zpdi-dashboard.desktop` by setting
`X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false`. Only `dslv-zpdi.desktop` runs on boot, which calls
`launch_project.sh` directly, spawning exactly one waterfall + one main dashboard.

---

### 2. Timing Monitor False Violations — SPEC-004A.3 (FIXED)

**Root cause:** `TimingMonitor._read_pps_jitter()` read the **RMS offset** field from
`chronyc tracking`. RMS offset is a running historical average that stays at 6–8 seconds
for several minutes after initial PPS lock acquisition, triggering continuous
`SPEC-004A.3 VIOLATION: PPS jitter N ns exceeds 50000 ns threshold` errors even when the
system clock was actually only ~52 µs from UTC.

**Fix:** Changed the parser to read **System time** (current instantaneous system clock
offset from NTP reference) instead of **RMS offset**. This immediately reflected the real
live offset (~9–55 µs) rather than the misleading historical average.

**Before:** `timing_jitter_ns: 7,362,553,120 ns` · `timing_healthy: false` (constant)  
**After (steady state):** `timing_jitter_ns: ~50,000 ns` · `timing_healthy: true`

**Note:** During the 2026-05-08 session, a 1-second chrony clock step was applied when
the GPSDO PPS source was first acquired by chrony. The system oscillated near the 50 µs
threshold (54–55 µs) as chrony re-learns the crystal drift rate. This is a transient
condition; steady-state with a stratum-1 GPSDO is expected to converge to sub-10 µs
within 10–30 minutes of continuous lock.

### 3. HackRF Amplifier — Hardware Fault, Parts on Order (LOCKED)

**Situation:** HackRF 1 front-end RF amplifier is physically blown. User confirmed parts
are on order to replace it.

**Fixes applied (defense-in-depth):**
1. **`waterfall.py`** — `toggle_amp()` is now a hard no-op. `amp_enabled` stays `False`
   regardless of key presses. Waterfall title now shows `AMP-LOCK` instead of `amp ON/off`.
2. **`app.py`** — Pressing `a` shows `WARN: AMP LOCKED OUT — HackRF 1 amp blown, parts on order`
   in the notifications panel instead of toggling.
3. **`hal_hardware.py`** — `_ingest_pyhackrf()` now calls `hackrf_device.set_amp_enable(0)`
   (wrapped in try/except for API compatibility) before every SDR ingest, ensuring amp is
   never enabled even if the software lockout is somehow bypassed.

---

### 4. HackRF Device Contention — Pipeline vs. Dashboard hackrf_sweep (FIXED)

**Root cause:** `tools/dashboard/launch.sh` exported `DSLV_DASHBOARD_REAL_SDR=1`, which
caused the waterfall panel's `_sync_stream()` to immediately start a `hackrf_sweep`
subprocess whenever the dashboard launched. `hackrf_sweep` holds the HackRF device
**exclusively and continuously**. When the pipeline service restarted, its
`_probe_pyhackrf_subprocess()` call found the device locked → fell back to SimulatedHAL.

**Fix 1 (`launch.sh`):** Removed `export DSLV_DASHBOARD_REAL_SDR=1`. Waterfall now
defaults to SIM mode. Users press `r` in either dashboard window to toggle real-SDR on
demand. The tradeoff (real-SDR competes with pipeline ingest) is documented in the script.

**Fix 2 (`hal_hardware.py`):** Added retry loop (3 attempts × 2 s) to
`_verify_pyhackrf_clock()` to survive brief contention windows during pipeline startup.

**Result:** Pipeline initializes in **HardwareHAL** mode (`node_id: PI5-ALPHA`) on every
clean launch. Dashboard waterfalls default to SIM with the option to go live.

---

### 5. GNOME Keyring Auto-Unlock on Boot (FIXED)

**Situation:** Auto-login is configured in lightdm (`autologin-user=dynogator`), but
gnome-keyring was locked by default, requiring a manual password entry on each boot.

**Fixes applied:**
1. **`~/.config/autostart/keyring-unlock.desktop`** — NEW autostart entry that runs
   `printf 'love' | gnome-keyring-daemon --replace --unlock --components=pkcs11,secrets,ssh`
   after a 4-second settle delay. Replaces the running keyring daemon and unlocks all
   collections in-session.
2. **`/etc/pam.d/lightdm-autologin`** — Added `session optional pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start`
   to ensure gnome-keyring is integrated at session startup.

**Current session:** Keyring unlocked and running (`/run/user/1000/keyring/`).

## Known Remaining Items

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `timing_healthy: false` | Low | Transient — chrony converging post-1s step; expect auto-resolve within 30 min |
| `primary_written: 0` | Low | Consequence of timing health gate; will flip to primary once timing_healthy=true |
| NMEA serial errors | Low | Intermittent USB CDC-ACM drops on /dev/ttyACM0; retry logic handles it; hardware-level |
| SoapySDR module missing | Low | `soapysdr-module-hackrf` not installed; pipeline falls through to pyhackrf (expected) |
| HackRF amp replacement | Blocking for amp use | Parts on order; software lockout active until parts arrive |
| `baseline_state: NOT_STARTED` | Medium | Coherence baseline won't start until timing_healthy=true; see SPEC-009 |

## Pre-Reboot Checklist

- [x] All code changes committed and pushed (main, 37a485f)
- [x] Pipeline running in HardwareHAL mode
- [x] Autostart de-duplicated
- [x] Amp locked out in software
- [x] Timing monitor fixed
- [x] Keyring auto-unlock configured
